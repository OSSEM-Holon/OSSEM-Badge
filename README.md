# OSSEM-Badge
An attempt at making a badge. Although we say "badge" here like it's a DEFCON
badge, this is more of a learning platform for OSSEM and this is the repository
where members of OSSEM can get the badge firmware and share their own spin on
their firmware. More importantly members can explore programming, electronic
basics and many other topics. The idea here is to keep this project completely
open for the OSSEM community to learn, teach and play. 

## How this repository is organized
It was decided that this project should focus on one component at a time. For
example, the first lesson focuses on an OLED LCD screen. A **minimum** of two
weeks will be spent understanding the OLED LCD and how to interface with it
(libraries, I2C, etc.). Of course this approach can change as members see fit!
The other components of the badge will follow a similar pattern learning each
component. It is not necessary to have a *deep* understanding of the components.
