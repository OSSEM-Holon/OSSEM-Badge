# OSSEM-Badge
An attempt at making a badge. Here is the repository where members of OSSEM can
get the OSSEM badge firmware and share their own spin on their firmware. The
hardware required for the badge development is:
- [STM32F103C8T6](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DLIJOAO/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [ST-Link
  v2](https://www.amazon.com/Qunqi-ST-LINK-STLINK-debugger-programmer/dp/B016ZPNEYC/ref=sr\_1\_1?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1484330473&sr=1-1&keywords=st-link+v2)
- Since the agreed upon first objective for this project is to understand how to
  write and interface with the LCD, you will need [SSD1306
  OLED](https://www.amazon.com/Diymall-Serial-128x64-Display-Arduino/dp/B00O2LKEW2/ref=sr_1_1?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1484331448&sr=1-1&keywords=ssd1306+oled)
- A various collection of
  [resistors](https://www.amazon.com/E-Projects-EPC-103-Value-Resistor-Kit/dp/B00E9YQQSS/ref=sr_1_3?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1484331498&sr=1-3&keywords=resistors)
- [Breadboard](https://www.amazon.com/eBoot-Experiment-Solderless-Breadboard-400-Points/dp/B01MG5IPUX/ref=sr_1_1?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1484331573&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=breadboard&psc=1)
. The bigger the better.
All of the above are links to Amazon. Some other good sources for these parts
are Digikey, Mouser and Ebay. These are only some of the places to acquire the
necessary parts.

# Setup
An effort has/will be made to ensure that users/developers are able to
learn on different operating systems. Currently the following operating systems
have a setup guide:
- [Ubuntu 16.04](docs/ubuntu-badge-setup-how-to.md)
